   Conducted an in-depth exploration of the most quoted ETFs, unraveling insights from the data.

2. **NLP-based Sentiment Analysis:**
   Developed artificial intelligence algorithms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract sentiment from various sources.

3. **Bitcoin Price Prediction:**
   Integrated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with a deep neural network to predict the price of Bitcoin. This model is based on both quote and sentiment data and is showcased in a user-friendly Streamlit application.
